# CamJam Edukit 3 - Robotics

![CamJam EduKit 3 - Robotics](http://camjam.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edukit3_1500-Alex-Eames-sm.jpg)

The code contained within this repository is for use with the CamJam Edukit 3 - Robotics, created by the organisers of The Cambridge Raspberry Jam (http://camjam.me), an event for fans of the Raspberry Pi.

There are two versions of the instructions:

* GPIO Zero - using the easy-to-use GPIO Zero library to control the GPIO Pins
* RPi.GPIO - the original and more complex way of controlling GPIO Pins. These worksheets are no longer supported; we advise you to use the GPIO Zero versions.

The kit costs only Â£20 including UK VAT, and is available from [The Pi Hut](http://thepihut.com/collections/camjam-edukit)

## Modified for the Science Accelerating Girls Education Program
### Jennefer Maldonado - Brookhaven National Laboratory

* The target audience was high school aged girls interested in learning more about STEM fields.
* Added to this repository are slides for participants.
* Slides include BNL examples, brief introduction to the project, SSH instructions, and basics of editing python code from this original repository.
* The final slide introduces the webbased control which allowed the students to drive the robots around the classroom remotely.
